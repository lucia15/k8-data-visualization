# Label Synchronisation accross all repositores

### Usage (Automatic)
The label synchronisation utilises a CI pipeline (label_maker.yml) that runs every hour to look out for any new repositories and apply the labels.

### Usage (Manual)
1. Install go, if you don't have it installed. Click [here] for directions.
2. Clone the repo
```sh
$ GO111MODULE=off go get github.com/k8-proxy/k8-data-visualization/labels 
```
3. Edit the file labels.json with the labels you want synchronised. eg
```sh
{
        "name": "QA Task",
        "description": "Quality Assurance needed",
        "color": "c2e0c6"
    },
    {
        "name": "merge conflict",
        "description": "Indicates a merge conflict.",
        "color": "fbca04"
    },
```
4. Implement the changes
```sh
$ GITHUB_TOKEN=mytoken github-labeller ORGANISATION
```
where "mytoken" is your personal github token, "ORGANISATION" is the organisation to which the repos belong.
